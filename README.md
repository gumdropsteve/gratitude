# Gratitude
Gratitude is a AI chatbot companion that sends a daily message to users asking what they are grateful for. It remembers the user and thoughtfully builds a profile around them and their stories. 

## Benefits of Gratitude
The Mayo Clinic has found that expressing gratitude is associated with a host of mental and physical benefits. 
"Studies have shown that feeling thankful can improve sleep, mood and immunity. 
Gratitude can decrease depression, anxiety, difficulties with chronic pain and risk of disease."

Amanda Logan, APRN, C.N.P. has drawn such conviction from the research that she prescribes gratitude, and says if there were "a pill that could do this, everyone would be taking it."

Gratitude aims to be that pill.

## Initial meeting
On activation, Gratitude starts by asking for a user's name, then sends the first daily message. Gratitude adopts to user preferences over time to become a moment of blissful reflection.
